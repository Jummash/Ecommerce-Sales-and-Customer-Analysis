# 🛒 E-commerce Sales & Customer Behavior Analysis (Excel Dashboard Project)
Interactive Excel dashboards analyzing e-commerce sales performance, patterns and customer behavior

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **e-commerce sales performance and customer behavior** using Excel.  
The goal was not only to build visually appealing dashboards but to **transform raw data into stories that drive actionable insights** — uncovering what drives sales, who the customers are, and how businesses can act on those insights.


The analysis was split into two interactive dashboards:
1. **Sales Performance Dashboard** → answering the *what, when, where* of sales.  
2. **Customer Behavior Dashboard** → answering the *who, why, and how* behind purchases.

### 1️⃣ E-commerce Sales Overview Dashboard 
Focus: Sales trends, product categories, regional distribution, discounts, payment and purchase channels.

**Key Insights:**
- 💰 **Total Sales**: $275.1K across 1,000 orders; average order value (AOV) $275.1  
- 📊 **Month-over-Month (MoM) Changes**:  
   - Sales decreased by **17%**  
   - Orders decreased by **20%**  
   - AOV increased by **3%** — suggesting customers spent slightly more per order despite fewer purchases.  
- 📉 **Monthly Trend**: Sales dipped during the festive season (Oct–Dec), an unexpected finding given categories like fashion, jewelry, and food typically perform well.  
- 📈 **Peak Month**: April recorded the highest sales ($28.6K), while September led in “Mixed” purchase channels.  
- 🔍 **Sales Drivers**: Strong positive correlation between sales and social media engagement; ads showed only weak impact.  
- 🌍 **Regional Spread**: Sales were distributed thinly across many regions — a *long tail distribution*. Doubling down on top-performing regions could dramatically increase impact.  
- 🛍️ **Discounts**: 51.90% of transactions involved discounts.

 ## Recommendations:
  1. Hire a skilled social media manager who understands e-commerce dynamics.
  2. Partner with influencers tailored to each demographic: - Gen Z → fashion, beauty, jewelry - Millennials/Gen X → baby items, home tools, gardening products
 3. Offer discounts/referral codes to drive conversions.
 4. Focus marketing on top-performing regions instead of spreading resources everywhere.

    ### 2️⃣ Customer Behavior & Purchase Insights Dashboard
Focus: Who the customers are, why they buy, and how they spend.

**Key Insights:**
- 👥 **Top-Contributing Age Group**: 27–29 years generated the highest sales overall.  
- 💳 **Hidden Pattern**: Filtering by gender revealed males aged 47–50 (often widowed/divorced) contributed the most in spending.  
- 🛒 **Purchase Intent**: Wants-based purchases dominate across genders; need-based and planned purchases were less frequent.  
- 💍 **Marital Status**: Married & Widowed customers showed the highest engagement and purchase frequency.  
- 🚚 **Shipping Preference**: Standard delivery (37%) was most common, followed by Express (30%).  
- ⭐ **Top-Rated Products**: Travel & Leisure (3.58), Toys & Games (3.47), Baby Products (3.46).  
- 🎯 **Loyalty Membership**: Even split between members (49.44%) and non-members (50.56%).

## 🔧 Project Workflow
1. **Data Source**: Downloaded the *E-commerce Consumer Behavior dataset* from Kaggle.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Used Power Query to handle missing values, reformat columns, and prepare for analysis.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Leveraged Pivot Tables & Scatter Plots to identify trends and relationships.  
4. **Dashboard Design**: Built two dashboards in Excel with slicers (Gender, Month, Social Media Influence, Purchase Channel, Payment Method).  
5. **Interactivity**: Used slicers and linked charts for scenario exploration (e.g., segmenting by gender or channel).  
6. **Insights & Recommendations**: Summarized findings into actionable business strategies.
